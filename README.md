To provide the smoothest possible exprience for developers. REST APIs SHOOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive.

## Introduction

When building a digital ecosystem API usability becomes a business priority. Success of your ecosystem depends on APIs that are easy to discover, simple to use, fit for purpose, and consistent across your products.

This document offers guidance that TotalEnergies API producer teams MUST follow to
ensure that the various solutions has a consistent and easy to use API surface. A new API design should meet the
following goals:

\- Developer friendly via consistent naming, patterns, and web standards (HTTP,
REST, JSON)

\- Easy-to-use API and high adoption rate.

\- Sustainable & evolvable via clear API contracts.

These guidelines serve as the means by which API teams discuss and come to consensus on API review requirements.

Technology and software are constantly changing and evolving, and as such, this
is intended to be a living document. API guidelines that change frequently lead to an uneven and inconsistent API surface. Consequently, this document will more frequently change to add guidance in areas previously uncovered, or to clarify existing guidance. It will less frequently change the directional guidance it has already provided. [Open an
issue](https://github.com/AJ1056682/api-guidelines/issues) to suggest
a change or propose a new idea.
